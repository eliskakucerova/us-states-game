### US states game

The project is a simple game in which the player is asked to guess all 50 states of the US. When the player enters the secret word 'Exit', a list of the states that they still need to learn is generated.
  
The project is written in Python. This project was created to practice list comprehension and Pandas library.

### Setup

Python 3.10.3 version was used. Are you uncertain about your version? Use command line `python --version`.
The project depends on the Turtle and Pandas libraries.

### How to run?

You can run the script from PyCharm, which was used during creating the code, but it depends on your preferences.
 
### Important information

The code was written by me as the part of the online course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Projects created by Dr. Angela Yu.
The tutorial was used mainly to check whether the code is correct and for little help.
